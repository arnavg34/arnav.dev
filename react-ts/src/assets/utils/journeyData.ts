    description: `One of the biggest challenges we saw in Imagine was beginners feeling overwhelmed. So I helped design a structured, two-week project curriculum to mentor students and help them reach their full potential.
  
  The website now features a growing library of project tracks — ranging from JavaScript web apps and Python scripts to mobile applications and full-stack builds using frameworks like Spring Boot, React, Express, and Flask. We turned core concepts like asynchronous programming and the DOM into bite-sized, hands-on sprints.
  
  Watching members go from confused to confident has been one of the most rewarding parts of my journey. We’re currently expanding the platform and forming partnerships — what started with a few curious members is now being used by hundreds across our community.`

    description: `I joined Imagine Software Club as a Computer Engineering student unsure whether I wanted to pursue software or focus on hardware. But I quickly found myself immersed in a passionate community of builders. What started as attending weekly meetings turned into leading full projects and mentoring new members.
  
  Over my time at Imagine, I've held several roles — starting as Secretary, then Event Director, Educational Director, and now Project Director. Along the way, I’ve helped teach students foundational skills like JavaScript, supported their first deployments, and guided them through their first full-stack apps.
  
  I’m proud to be part of the core team that helped Imagine grow from 50 members to over 650. It’s where I truly found my passion for software — and built lifelong connections along the way. With growing partnerships and connections to companies like Amazon, LinkedIn, Slalom, and Humana, Imagine is bound to grow beyond just Michigan State University.`
